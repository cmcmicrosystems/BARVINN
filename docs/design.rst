Design
============

Top Module
-----------------
BARVINN is a Barrel RISC-V Neural Network Accelerator. The main purpose of designing BARVINN was to fill the need for arbitrary precision neural network accelerator. The overall architecture of BARVINN is illustrated below:

  BARVINN overall architecture.


BARVINN is an FPGA proven accelerator. :numref:`fig_barvinn_top` illustrates the overall system design for BARVINN. It is consist of the following components:

- Array of Matrix Vector Units
- RISC-V Controller Core
- Host Machine

In the following sections, we will review each part in details. 



Matrix Vector Unit (MVU) Array
------------------------------

In the base configuration, BARVINN uses 8 MVUs. At every clock cycle, each MVU is capable of performing a ternary matrix vector product of the following size:

- Input Vector of 1 x 64 with 2 bit precision
- Weight Matrix of 64 x 64 with 1 bit precision

These MVUs are connected through a cross bar

RISC-V Controller
-----------------
As mentioned earlier, MVU array has many configuration settings. We used a barrel RISC-V design as a controller to send control signals to each MVU. The connection between the controller and the MVU array is through control status registers (CSRs). 

Barrel RISC-V 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A barrel processor is a form of a fine-grain multithreading processor that exploits thread-levelparallelism by switching between different threads on each clock cycle (Hennessey and Patterson,2011). The aim is to maximize the overall utilization of the processorâ€™s resources, and instructionthroughput. This is similar to the technique of simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) that is used inmodern superscalar processors. However, unlike SMT superscalar processors, barrel processors donot issue more than one instruction per clock cycle. Instead, a single execution pipeline is shared byall threads.
